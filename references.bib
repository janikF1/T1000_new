abstract = {Software requirements have an important role in achieving reliability for operational systems like remote handling: requirements are the basis for architectural design decisions and also the main cause of defects in high quality software. We analyze related recommendations and requirements given in software safety standards, handbooks etc. and apply them to remote handling control systems, which typically have safety-critical functionality, but are not actual safety-systems⿿for example the safety-systems in ITER will be hardware-based. Based on the analysis, we develop a set of generic recommendations for control system software requirements, including quality attributes, software fault tolerance, and safety and as an example we analyze ITER remote handling system software requirements to identify and present dependability requirements in a useful manner. Based on the analysis, we divide a high-level control system into safety-critical and non-safety-critical subsystems, and give examples of requirements that support building a dependable system.}
