abstract = {In this research, we developed software for designing the optimum shape of multi-MW wind turbine blades and analyzing the performance, and it features aerodynamic shape design, performance analysis, pitch–torque analysis and shape optimization for wind turbine blades. In order to verify the accuracy of the performance analysis results of the software developed in this research, we chose the 5 MW blade, designed by NREL, as the comparison model and compared with the analysis results of well known commercial software (GH-Bladed). The calculated performance analysis results of GH-Bladed and our software were consistent in all values of CP in all λ ranges. Also, to confirm applicability of the optimum design module, the optimum design of the new 5 MW blade was performed using the initial design data of the comparison model and found that solidity was smaller in our design even though it produced the same output and efficiency. Through optimization of blade design, efficiency increased by 1% while the thrust coefficient decreased by 7.5%.}
